# Meeting-notes
Notes from RugbyLug meetings

The Rugby Lug operate a quarterly rota in order to provide:

- a social to decide on a suitable project to work on and discuss it
- a project session to hack on the chosen project (could be >1 session)
- a quarterly, dedicated tech talk evening to share knowledge about the project or any other relevant topic

This repo is used to store notes relating to meetings and projects.

# Activity proposals

## Software Freedom Day

Software Freedom Day [1] falls annually on the 3rd Saturday of
September. We haven't had an event for a few years now, but it might
be a good time to consider having another as projects have further
matured and gained more share (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Scratch, 3D
printing, Nextcloud, LibreOffice, the browser ecosystem, ...)

This year's event may also provide an opportunity to work on material
(Odoo, virtualisation, ...) that may additionally be of interest to
participants in the Coventry & Warwickshire Business Festival [2],
which occurs 19-30th November.

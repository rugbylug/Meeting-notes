# RugbyLug Project #1:
# Open Source (and useful) mobile device project

This project is to test the theory that a non-proprietary device can be useful as an every-day device.

## Proposal
The suggestion is to be able to set up an Android device with an up to date ROM in a way that puts the user in control of their device and without requiring a 3rd party cloud service or proprietary applications to have access to any data on the device.

An added benefit is that this gives a new lease of life to old devices which otherwise would not have access to security updates and new features.

The proposed ROM is Lineage OS which is stated as a 'continuation of what CyanogenMod was'. Lineage also suggests some GDPR functionality built in. Details of the latest build are here: https://lineageos.org/Changelog-17/ (Note the April fools features).

As a consequence of not installing a 3rd party app store on the device (gapps), common applications (Docs, Drive, Hangouts, Play etc) will not be available so alternatives are rerquired.

## Schedule

- Thursday 19th April - Social - Project Planning (venue TBD)
- Thursday 17th May - Project hacking (OpusVL)
- Thursday 21st June - Tech Talk Evening (OpusVL)

## Apps and alternatives

This is a list of applications that provide similar functionality to thiose provided with the device but are all Open Source.

## ROMs

* Can someone take a look at the ROM download sources so we can locate relatively safe ROMs from the official Lineage distributions.

## Devices

The following devices have been made available for experimentation:
- Asus Transformer TF101 (SJM)
- Samsung Tab 3 (SM-T210) (SJM)
- HTC One Mini 2 (SJM)
